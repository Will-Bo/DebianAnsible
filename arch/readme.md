# Arch Deployment Script
Using my Ansible Debian deployment script to automatically deploy Arch Linux systems.

## Usage
Just run the `setup.sh` script (type `chmod +x setup.sh; ./setup.sh` in your terminal). You'll be prompted if you're running Artix, but the script assumes that you're using Artix with runit.
